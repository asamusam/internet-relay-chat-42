1. Client connects to the server using correct port
2. Server instantiates the client structure/object with default values (all empty/false)
3. Any message received by the server from the client goes to parseMessage() with the following parameters:
    - app structure (server database)
    - client instance
    - message string
    - buffer to store the resulting message
4. parseMessage() returns:
    - if -1, do nothing
    - if 0, the message is fully valid, execute it
    - if >0, send the message stored in the buffer back to the client
