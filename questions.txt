Questions and things to discuss

1. Consider storing clients in map with nicknames as keys instead of ids, 
   because we will often need to find a client by nickname: privmsg, invite, registration.
2. PASS command. Consider closing the connection when the client sends additional PASS command
   with wrong password after sending NICK or USER commands, before the registration is complete. 
   Now we just send ERR_PASSWDMISMATCH.
3. USER command doesnâ€™t have a specified error for cases when the provided username is invalid (contains spaces).
   Current behavior is to ignore such messages.
4. Future security enhancements: limit the number of attempts to send PASS command
   and store the password in the configuration file.


What if the channel is invite only and key enabled at the same time?
Can you invite users to a channel that is already full?
Can the invitation be revoked or does the user just hangs in invited indefinitely?
